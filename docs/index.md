    🍪 My Quick Reference is designed to align intuitively with the way I think. I highly recommend creating your own personalized version during your preparation. It helps you quickly access what you actually need—without cluttering your main cheat sheet with things you already know.

### Curious how I got a free OSCP exam? Check out my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@pakcyberbot/how-i-got-a-free-oscp-exam-directly-from-offsec-c54e562121c5) where I share the full story

## My OSCP Environment

I built and continuously enhanced my personal OSCP-pentest environment over time—polishing tool layouts, workflows, and integrations to match my exact needs. Now, anyone can replicate that fully optimized setup in just seconds by running `OSCP_envsetup.sh`, which you’ll find in the pakcyberbots_OSCP_environment folder.

### 🔧 What It Includes

* **Multi‑terminal layout**
  Opens multiple Terminator windows with split panels, each pre‑configured with the proper environment variables for various scenarios — including a full OSCP exam setup.

* **Markdown-to-PDF reporting**
  One command transforms Obsidian-style notes into polished PDFs, complete with captions, borders, and consistent styling—perfect for formal deliverables.

* **Terminal session logging**
  Automatically records everything typed or output in my shell (even reverse shells). A lifesaver when creating logs after the fact or catching something I missed.

* **Smart HTTP file server (`fuzzy-httpserver`)**
  Launches a dynamic HTTP server that autocorrects typos, allows quick upload, and ships with a library of pentest binaries—ideal for sharing tools during engagements.

* **BloodHound via Docker (`bloodhound-docker`)**
  Instantly deploys or tears down BloodHound containers with pre-defined settings—no manual setup required.

* **Obsidian Markdown templates**
  Includes ready-to-use templates for note-taking, vulnerability write-ups, and final reporting. Uses the Templater plugin to auto-fill IPs, timestamps, and structure.

* **Terminator shortcuts**
  Includes keybindings for:

  * Vertical split: Ctrl + Shift + L
  * Horizontal split: Ctrl + Shift + J
  * Zoom pane: Ctrl + Shift + Z
  * Close pane: Ctrl + Shift + W
  * Cycle panes: Ctrl + Tab
  * Switch to white theme: Ctrl + N

### 🎯 Why It Works

* **Speed & consistency** – I can spin up my complete environment in one go, with no manual fiddling.
* **Professional output** – Notes and logs are formatted cleanly for professional-grade deliverables.
* **Focused on OSCP workflows** – The tools and layouts reflect the real exam environment.
* **Extensible & shareable** – Everything is portable, themable, and easy to tweak or expand.

You can match this setup in just seconds: download and run **`OSCP_envsetup.sh`** present inside my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PakCyberbot/OSCP-Notes-and-Environment/) — and replicate my environment exactly.
